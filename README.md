# Decision Tree Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing the application of decision trees in machine learning. The notebook explores various aspects of decision trees, including their working principles, implementation in Python using scikit-learn library, visualization techniques, and pruning methods.

## Main Highlights
- **Metrics Covered**: The notebook provides an overview of key metrics commonly used in decision trees, including Gini impurity, entropy, information gain, and mean squared error (MSE).
  
- **Decision Tree Workflow**: It elucidates the fundamental workings of decision trees, explaining how they make decisions based on feature values and split criteria.
  
- **Implementation in Python**: The notebook demonstrates how to create decision trees using Python's scikit-learn library, including preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.
  
- **Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing decision trees are explored, offering insights into the tree's structure and decision-making process.
  
- **Pruning Methods**: Both pre-pruning and post-pruning techniques are discussed, providing strategies to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
  
- **Sample Data**: The repository includes two CSV files containing sample datasets used in the notebook. Note that these datasets are for illustrative purposes only and may not be suitable for real-world applications due to their limited sample size.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis conducted in the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
4. Explore the code and results to gain insights into decision tree analysis.

## Note
While the provided datasets serve as a tutorial for understanding decision trees, they are not recommended for use in real-world scenarios due to their small sample size. For practical applications, consider using larger and more diverse datasets.
